    <p> I am in favor of clear and protects the environment. I believe that if we improve environmental protection then everyone benefits. Who dosen’t love the green outside with the air fresh and sweet. I believe that clean water & nature is essential. It’s vital for survival, let alone our health and safety. We have to protect the sources of it so that everyone can enjoy it as well. I believe that we need to provide clean nature and protect the environment so that everyone can be healthy and happy. The environment is not only getting worse, but it's also affecting our health too. It's time for us to take action and do something about it. If we don't want to see an even worse future, then we should start taking care of the environment now. </p>
